# Huffman Coding in Python

This project implements the **Huffman Coding algorithm** for lossless text compression using Python. It builds a binary tree based on character frequencies and generates variable-length prefix codes to reduce the total number of bits needed to store a string.

## Features

- Builds a Huffman Tree using a min-heap (priority queue)
- Generates binary codes for each character based on frequency
- Encodes a given input string into a binary string
- Decodes the binary string back to the original text
- Prints original vs encoded size to show compression

## Technologies used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Concepts:** Greedy algorithm, Binary tree, Priority queue (`heapq` module)

## How to run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Run:
